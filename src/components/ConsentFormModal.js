                    This research aims to explore issues related to the death of
                    Software Ecosystems in the context of Software Engineering,
                    analyzing metrics that help establish reference points for
                    the vital signs of the ecosystem. In this way, it may be
                    possible to identify anomalous signals that may indicate the
                    decline of ecosystems in advance.
